# Personal budget
A site where you can track your expenses, receipts and compare them. To use the functionality that this site provides, you need to register, after that you can add the source of income, the amount (by card or cash) and the date that it provides, then you can specify the sources of costs (similarly, add the name, cost and date), but not vice versa, so you canâ€™t buy something if there isn't money for it, it'll also be possible to compare costs and receipts for a certain month. The only thing that is available without registration is the total cost of the purchase, parts of which were bought by different people for different amounts of money, and everyone'll use it, in comparison how much each person spent and how much each buyer should pay (total amount divided by the number of buyers), it'll be considered how much he must pay or how much he must be paid
