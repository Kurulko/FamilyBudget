# Personal budget
A site where you can track your expenses, receipts and compare them. To use the functionality that this site provides, you need to register, after that you can add the source of income, the amount (by card or cash) and the date that it provides, then you can specify the sources of costs (similarly, add the name, cost and date), but not vice versa, so you canâ€™t buy something if there isn't money for it, it'll also be possible to compare costs and receipts for a certain month.
